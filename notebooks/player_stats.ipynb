    "  \"bio\": \"Ricky Ponting had all the ingredients of a typical Australian - tough as nails, aggressive, vocal and above all, mentally powerful to tackle pressure situations. The best quality about Ponting was his burning desire to win matches and at times, the desperation did bring up infamous incidents but what shone through his career was the sheer desire to be victorious. Three World Cup titles including two consecutive ones as captain to go with a couple of Champions Trophy titles and the no.1 Test ranking shows that he had seen it all in the international arena. Adding to all this was of course his free-wheeling strokeplay as a batsman, amassing runs at will and destroying opposition bowlers. The only title that eluded him was the World T20 but one could argue that the format came around the time that Ponting was in his final years. <br/>  <br/> A young and raw Ricky Ponting burst into the international arena in the year 1995 as he debuted in both the formats. He had garnered a big reputation in the domestic circuit for having the ability to produce the big runs and most people were in awe of his skill set. However, disciplinary issues were equally prevalent with Ricky back then and it did hound him in the initial years of his international career as well. But, he managed to pick himself up and from the 1998-99 season, started to mature steadily into a top flight batsman. Having started out as a middle order batsman, he also started to take ownership of the pivotal number three slot which he would make iconic in the years to follow.  <br/>  <br/> A highlight of Ponting's bowling was the sheer intent he had, right from the first ball. It wouldn't necessarily be an aerial shot, would just be that positive trigger movement forward and he didn't mind playing the pull/hook shot even off the front foot with incredible ease. In fact, that stroke went onto become Ponting's signature shot in his career. He rarely let the bowlers to dictate terms and most of the times, bullied them into submission. His upward spike as a batsman meant that the leadership role wasn't far away. With Steve Waugh declining, captaincy finally came to Ponting in 2002 when he was at the peak of his powers as a batsman. Over the next 5 years, not only did he as a captain win consecutive World Cups and Champions Trophy titles, but also went up to another level as a batsman. <br/>  <br/> From 2002-2007, Ponting smashed an insane 41 international centuries across formats - testimony of the dominance he had over the bowlers. Apart from the limited-overs glory, Australia were also ruthless in Tests, carrying forward the legacy created by Steve Waugh. However, it wasn't all rosy for Ricky, especially in the longest format where the pain of losing the Ashes series happened to him thrice. It wasn't hard to understand the fact that he enjoyed captaining in the shorter format more as his creativity worked well in white-ball cricket whereas in Tests, his tactics were mostly revolving around the starry bowling attack. Once the senior bowlers left, Ponting started to feel the heat and although the story was similar in ODIs, he had a better grip over proceedings. <br/>  <br/> After the 2011 World Cup where Australia were eliminated in the quarterfinal, Ponting stood down from leadership and Michael Clarke was thrust to the role for all formats. 'Punter' as he is fondly called, barely played any games after giving up captaincy and bid farewell to international cricket in the 2012-13 home series against South Africa. His last year for Australia was fidgety, as is the case with most ageing players and hence, wasn't able to end on a high. Nevertheless, Ponting's contributions are invaluable to Australian cricket and he remains the second best batsman ever produced by the country after the Don. Apart from the several silverware that we won, there were a plethora of records that he created which may be tough if not impossible to break. <br/>  <br/> At the time of his retirement, Ponting was only second to Sachin Tendulkar in terms of total international runs and centuries. A true legend of the game, Ricky even played a part in the IPL although not much with much individual success. After a few torrid years with KKR, he shifted to MI where he even opened with Tendulkar - a rare feast for cricket lovers. However, Ponting soon realized that he wasn't adjusting well enough to the format and gave up captaincy to become a mentor of the side. That same season MI won their first ever IPL trophy and Ponting coached them to their second one in 2015. Ponting harbors hopes of coaching the Australian team and has even been a stop-gap replacement at times, especially in T20s. When not doing such assignments, he works as  TV commentator and is a delight to listen. <br/>  <br/> <b>By Hariprasad Sadanandan</b> <br/> \",\n",

Ponting perhaps. Maybe Kallis. <i>Run machines</i>, we call them. And if you’ve watched them bat, you’re likely to agree. They were so good at their craft that they had basically invented their own technique... <br/>  <br/> However, there exists another breed of cricketers in the same league who have had to rely more on hard work rather than cricketing aptitude. They tend to develop a standard technique like a computer-based batting simulator would. Through hard work and perseverance, they have crafted an airtight technique through conventional means and made it work in international cricket; a technique so perfect and versatile that it suits all conditions, and works equally well in attack and defense. <br/>  <br/> Rahul Dravid, also known as, the Wall – a rather clever term coined by a journalist, according to Dravid himself, that could later be modified, depending on his batting form. Prospective modifications include “crack in the wall” or “hole in the wall”. Nevertheless, if there was ever a batting technique that could be used as a blueprint to create a computer simulation for cricket shots, it has to be Rahul Dravid’s. <br/>  <br/> A blistering 95 on debut at Lord’s, perhaps overshadowed by Sourav Ganguly’s 131. A gritty 217 at the Oval in 2002, a chanceless, flawless 148 on a green Leeds surface, shielding the middle-order from the live-grass and paving the way for Ganguly’s fluent 128 and Tendulkar’s flamboyant 193. It’s not often that a Sachin knock gets overshadowed, but Dravid’s 148 was probably the best knock he’s ever played; even better than each of his 5 double-hundreds. I say this because most gritty knocks on green surfaces are accompanied by a bit of luck. This required nothing. It is chance-less. No plays and misses, a couple of close leaves, but Dravid had the edge throughout. And he won the battle, having played out the new ball and scored a century. <br/>  <br/> In 2007, India won the series under his leadership (although in terms of batting this tour wasn’t up to his standards: 1 fifty in 6 innings). However, he still looked comfortable while batting, especially with the first part of his job: shielding the middle-order from the new ball in case the openers fail. <br/>  <br/> And 2011 was just a one-man show. Sachin showed up and made 3 fifties, including a 90 at the Oval, but it was Dravid, with 3 hundreds, including one at Lord’s that he missed out on on his debut, who ran a one-man show in England as the other aging stalwarts of the Indian team had fitness issues and failed miserably. In Nottingham, he carried the bat throughout the innings for a hundred, opened the batting again when the follow-on was enforced. <br/>  <br/> So clearly, a man with a high-back lift has managed to do quite well in England. Specifically against the new-ball on fresh grassy surfaces. It doesn’t get more challenging than that for a subcontinent batsman who has grown up using his feet to get to the pitch of the ball on rank turners. <br/>  <br/> Rahul Dravid was perhaps <i>the</i> best in the world at handling the first part of the number 3 batsman’s job: shielding the stroke-makers and the stars from the new ball. Several celebrated batsmen owe him their hundreds and double-hundreds to Rahul Dravid, who has pulled off countless blockathons and leaveathons to see off vicious spells on treacherous seaming wickets. <br/>  <br/> For a major part of the 2000s decade, he did the first part of his task and then proceeded to make big runs for the team too. He did go through a dry spell individually when he started getting out to the left-arm quick; not because he had a technical chink, but because he was getting beaten by unplayable deliveries and was going through an inevitable dip in form. The heavy run-scoring wasn’t really happening, owing to which he adjusted his technique, started playing late with his fore-arms.  <br/>  <br/> He realized his wrists weren’t as strong as before and started focusing on 'economy of movement' and check-drives rather than running his hands through the ball. By the time India toured New Zealand and England in 2009 and 2011 respectively, he was back at his best at the ripe age of 38, protecting the middle-order stroke-players from the new ball, as well as scoring hundreds in England like he spent his childhood batting on a wet, skiddy Nottingham strip. <br/>  <br/> I think its quite clear how important Rahul Dravid was to the Indian team. He did every thankless job for the team, such as protecting the middle-order from the new ball, in addition to scoring runs. Of course, people only look at the runs. Sachin’s 193 features above Dravid’s 148 in that Leed’s Test scorecard. It was Sachin’s innings that stole the limelight because he went past the Don’s century tally. But the team knew what Dravid’s innings was worth. <br/>  <br/> This is a taboo topic in India, but Sachin would have found it much more difficult to make that 30th hundred, if Rahul Dravid had been dismissed sooner. I’m not saying that he wouldn’t have made a hundred. Sachin’s skill against the new ball and the old ball are unquestionable (his countless one-man-shows in the 90s). Lone performances by Sachin became the trend of Indian scorecards in the 90s. In the 2000s, however, Sachin suddenly had a support structure. He could play freely, and he could become one of many forces to reckon with in the Indian middle order. The aforementioned support structure happened to be Rahul Sharad Dravid – the new symbol of solidity and grit in the Indian batting line-up of the 21st century. <br/>  <br/> Dravid’s whole career reflected that of an unsung hero: do the hard work for the team, get overshadowed by a (metaphorically) colossal figure, and just walk away with a modest smile on your face. <br/>  <br/> Rahul Dravid was basically Sachin from the ’90s: A middle-order batsman facing the new ball and grinding it out to protect the middle-order so that the giants can come in and play their shots. He, however, had more capable and stable batsmen to support him, and a captain that understood him and stood by him. <br/>  <br/> He has done so much for Indian cricket. Not just as a batsman, but as a captain as well. His versatility is unquestionable, with his numbers, his countless innings of glory – 93 in the Perth victory of 2008, 233 and 72* at Adelaide, 270 at Rawalpindi (out reverse-sweeping to a part-timer just to up the scoring rate, with no regard to a potential 300) and the list goes on. <br/>  <br/> It’s all about getting the timing right. When do you show your technical prowess? When do you start playing your shots? Is this the right time to bat aggressively? Are you sure you have enough knowledge of the conditions to take risks now? That’s the kind of question an egocentric man can never answer truthfully. “Mujhe pataa hai.” will be the first words out of his mouth. “India Under-19 ke liye khela hoon mai.” <br/>  <br/> But Rahul Dravid is anything but delusional. <br/>  <br/> In a team with a genius like Sachin, a sorcerer like Laxman, swashbucklers like Sehwag and Dhoni, and the ever-so-volatile Sourav Ganguly, India needed a stabilizer. And they found one in Rahul Dravid. <br/>  <br/> He is still remembered for some of the slowest innings he has played: 21 off 140 at Nagpur, waving his bat after scoring his first run in 40 balls, to name a few. He was even hated for declaring with the nation’s beloved Sachin Tendulkar on 194*.  <br/>  <br/> Rahul Dravid, deserves to be remembered, for always, come what may, putting the team ahead of himself. For genuinely not caring what people thought about him as long as India won. The stable, humble man full of resolve and aggression, known even in Indian Pop Culture as Mr. Dependable, was one of the best things that happened to Indian cricket. <br/>  <br/> By <b>Rishi Roy</b>\", 'rankings': {'bat': {'testBestRank': '1', 'odiBestRank': '5'}, 'bowl': {}, 'all': {}}, 'appIndex': {'seoTitle': 'Rahul Dravid Profile - Cricbuzz | Cricbuzz.com', 'webURL': 'http://www.cricbuzz.com/profiles/27/rahul-dravid'}, 'DoBFormat': 'January 11, 1973', 'faceImageId': 156286, 'teamNameIds': [{'teamId': '2', 'teamName': 'India'}, {'teamId': '23', 'teamName': 'Scotland'}, {'teamId': '37', 'teamName': 'Asia XI'}, {'teamId': '17', 'teamName': 'ICC World XI'}, {'teamId': '59', 'teamName': 'Royal Challengers Bengaluru'}, {'teamId': '64', 'teamName': 'Rajasthan Royals'}, {'teamId': '290', 'teamName': 'Marylebone Cricket Club'}], 'playerTeamIds': '2, 23, 37, 17, 59, 64, 290', 'intlTeamImageId': 776162, 'recentBatting': {'headers': ['OPPN.', 'Score', 'Format', 'Date'], 'rows': [{'values': ['10714', 'AUS', '1(9) & 25(71)', 'Test', '24 Jan 12'], 'followUpLinkText': '/live-cricket-scores/10714/aus-vs-ind-4th-test-india-in-australia-test-series-2011-12'}, {'values': ['10713', 'AUS', '9(35) & 47(114)', 'Test', '13 Jan 12'], 'followUpLinkText': '/live-cricket-scores/10713/aus-vs-ind-3rd-test-india-in-australia-test-series-2011-12'}, {'values': ['10712', 'AUS', '5(33) & 29(73)', 'Test', '03 Jan 12'], 'followUpLinkText': '/live-cricket-scores/10712/aus-vs-ind-2nd-test-india-in-australia-test-series-2011-12'}, {'values': ['10711', 'AUS', '68(187) & 10(29)', 'Test', '26 Dec 11'], 'followUpLinkText': '/live-cricket-scores/10711/aus-vs-ind-1st-test-india-in-australia-test-series-2011-12'}, {'values': ['11068', 'WI', '82(149) & 33(49)', 'Test', '22 Nov 11'], 'followUpLinkText': '/live-cricket-scores/11068/ind-vs-wi-3rd-test-west-indies-in-india-2011'}]}, 'recentBowling': {'headers': ['OPPN.', 'Wickets', 'Format', 'Date'], 'rows': [{'values': ['5607', 'WI', '1-18 & DNB', 'Test', '10 May 02'], 'followUpLinkText': '/live-cricket-scores/5607/wi-vs-ind-4th-test-india-in-west-indies-test-series-2002'}, {'values': ['5945', 'ZIM', 'DNB & 0-15', 'Test', '25 Nov 00'], 'followUpLinkText': '/live-cricket-scores/5945/ind-vs-zim-2nd-test-zimbabwe-in-india-test-series-2000'}, {'values': ['5743', 'RSA', '1-16', 'ODI', '15 Mar 00'], 'followUpLinkText': '/live-cricket-scores/5743/ind-vs-rsa-3rd-odi-south-africa-in-india-odi-series-2000'}, {'values': ['5742', 'RSA', '0-9', 'ODI', '12 Mar 00'], 'followUpLinkText': '/live-cricket-scores/5742/ind-vs-rsa-2nd-odi-south-africa-in-india-odi-series-2000'}, {'values': ['5741', 'RSA', '2-43', 'ODI', '09 Mar 00'], 'followUpLinkText': '/live-cricket-scores/5741/ind-vs-rsa-1st-odi-south-africa-in-india-odi-series-2000'}]}}\n"

    "  \"bio\": \"Very few careers in international cricket have transcended the boundaries of myth as that of Ravindra Jadeja, nicknamed 'Sir'. The nickname initially trended more as a joke but the young man from Saurashtra took all the criticism and mock comments in his stride to turn the tables in spectacular fashion. A disastrous 2009 World T20 made him the laughing stock, particularly among the naturally combustible Indian fans who were baying for his blood back home. The 2009-10 season went haywire for the young man whose only solace was the immense backing from his skipper MS Dhoni who was adamant in his support of the all-rounder.  <br/>  <br/> A few quiet seasons followed and Jadeja unassumingly pegged away at the domestic circuit. Although known as a proper all-rounder there, it was evident that he was a more effective bowler, having the ability to hit a spot with relentless accuracy. Batting skills were no less - he has three triple tons in first-class cricket - that sums up things, doesn't it? Jadeja was slowly working his way in limited-overs cricket but clearly, it was his Test debut that changed his fortunes in a big way. His initiation in red-ball cricket came in a dead rubber of the home series against England in 2012-13. However, a fairly decent debut meant that he was retained when the Australians toured India in early 2013. Jadeja starred in that series along with the lead spinner Ravichandran Ashwin as India recorded a historic whitewash over the Aussies. <br/>  <br/> The same year he shone in India's Champions Trophy title glory, gaining the Golden Ball for his terrific bowling performances in the tournament. That international season was an emphatic statement - Jadeja had arrived. Since then, he hasn't looked back, becoming a force to reckon with in Tests, particularly in the sub-continent as India charged to number one in the rankings. His association with Ashwin has dismantled many opposition batting line-ups and is easily the best spin attack in the world. Injuries did hamper his form in the shorter formats and the new rule changes post the 2015 World Cup saw him being ineffective in white-ball cricket. Ashwin also struggled and the duo found themselves out of the limited-overs squads post the 2017 Champions Trophy. <br/>  <br/> India did finish runners-up in the showpiece event but there was a feeling that the vaunted Test partnership of Ashwin-Jadeja wasn't being replicated in white-ball cricket. The advent of wrist spinners has made things tough although Jadeja's multi-dimensional skills does keep him in the hunt. He is arguably India's best fielder and can tonk a few with the bat apart from his bowling skills. Supreme fitness levels also meant he was always on the radar for national selection whenever there was an opportunity. He returned to the ODI setup for the 2018 Asia Cup and played a sizeable amount of games since then, although he was dropped for a few as well. The all-round package that he is, Jadeja is a tough candidate for a captain to ignore because he is a live wire in the field, bowls decent spin and can give those extra few runs towards the end overs. Recurring injuries to Hardik Pandya in the 2018-19 season gave a new lease of life to Jadeja's white-ball dreams and he cemented his spot in the squad, featuring at no.7 whenever Hardik missed out and taking one of the specialist spinner slots when the latter returned. Jadeja's batting in Tests has also hit a peak over the last few years, making him a very reliable batsman irrespective of conditions. <br/>  <br/> He has been an all format player for India into his 30s as well. Jadeja was part of the 2023 ODI World Cup as well as the 2024 T20 World Cup. He announced his retirement from T20Is shortly after India became champions. Jadeja has been a steady eddy for India in limited overs cricket, and has been a proven match winner in home Tests.  <br/>  <br/> Jadeja was part of the Indian team that won the Champions Trophy in 2025, performing consistently throughout the tournament.  <br/>  <br/>  <br/> <b>IPL through the years</b> <br/>  <br/> Jadeja's rise does have a lot to do with Dhoni's undying support but it was actually the IPL that found the Saurashtra boy - or rather the legendary Shane Warne to be precise. As captain of the Rajasthan Royals, the Australian spotted Jadeja's prowess and had said back in 2008-09 that this 'Rockstar' would go places. He wasn't wrong at all. After featuring for Rajasthan briefly, Jadeja became an integral part of the Chennai outfit till the squad was briefly suspended after the 2015 season. During the side's two-year hiatus, its players were scattered across and Jadeja found himself with his native Gujarat franchise - a temporary side. With the Chennai squad returning from the 2018 season onwards, he was among the three people retained - proof enough of how much he is valued there. <br/>  <br/> After an outstanding 2021 IPL where he scored 227 runs and took 13 wickets, Jadeja was hot property ahead of the 2022 mega auction. CSK splurged INR 16 crore to acquire his services and made him captain. But after just 2 wins in their first 8 games, Jadeja handed back the captaincy to MS Dhoni to concentrate on his own game. He was subsequently ruled out of the season due to a rib injury. After reports of a rift between the franchise and Jadeja, the allrounder was reportedly spoken to and returned for the 2023 season. <br/>  <br/> Jadeja had a fairly quiet IPL season in 2023, but had his moment in the sun in the final against Gujarat Titans. With 10 runs needed off 2 deliveries, Jadeja whacked Mohit Sharma for a six and a four to etch his name forever in CSK folklore. The following season, Jadeja performed consistently despite CSK missing out on a spot in the playoffs. He was retained ahead of the 2025 mega auctions and will be back in CSK colours once again.  <br/>  <br/> <b>By Hariprasad Sadanandan</b>\",\n",
